  <summary>🚀 Embark on Abir Riahi's Journey</summary>

During my master's program, I contributed to interesting projects, focusing on groundbreaking research in speech enhancement using spiking neural networks. This immersive exploration at the intersection of technology and human-centric applications marked a pivotal stride in my pursuit of innovative solutions in this domain.

Before that, I explored semantic word embeddings, aiming to make language models more intuitive and accessible. This venture into language processing added a layer of depth to my skill set and understanding of data-driven applications.

Previously, I worked on the implementation of a Question-Answering System, leveraging recurrent networks. This project allowed me to apply my expertise in sequence modeling and natural language processing, honing my skills in creating intelligent systems that interact with and understand human language.

This journey is a perpetual exploration. Each project, whether triumphant or a learning experience, contributes to my evolution as a data scientist. As I persistently learn, experiment, and refine my skills, I look forward to the unfolding chapters of future projects and discoveries.
